How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Functionality starts in the IDE, making sure that code is formated and called correctly. Testing ensures that the code does what you wanted it to do and doesn't do what you didn't want. Likewise security starts with principals of encapsulation and input validation and is followed up by testing as well.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

By the time you are working ona  program the interprtation is long past done. Very clear and consise functional and technical requirements must be laid out, and guide every singel character of the code that is being developed. Information gathering and data reviews must be done up front and ongoing in the SDLC.

How do I approach designing software?

I start with requirements and make a plan. I then build one unit or portion of code at a time. I test to make sure the code is sound, then I add on. AM I still following the requirements? Is the new code playing nice with my existing code? When the code is tested is it tested both postiviely and negatively?
